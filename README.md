# Artemis-Financial
Financial Vulnerability Report

Client Overview

Artemis Financial is a financial services company that needed to enhance the security of its software applications. The primary issue they wanted to address was the lack of secure communication and data integrity within their existing systems.

Addressing Software Security Vulnerabilities

In identifying and addressing software security vulnerabilities for Artemis Financial, we successfully transitioned their system from HTTP to HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication. Additionally, we implemented SHA-256 checksum verification to maintain data integrity. Using the OWASP Dependency-Check tool, we identified and mitigated known vulnerabilities in their dependencies, maintaining the security of the application.

Importance of Secure Coding

Secure coding is critical because it protects sensitive data, prevents security breaches, and maintains user trust. For Artemis Financial, secure coding practices ensure compliance with industry regulations, protect financial information, and enhance the company's reputation. Software security adds significant value by safeguarding assets, reducing risks, and fostering customer confidence.

Challenges and Helpful Aspects

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring that the transition to HTTPS did not disrupt existing functionalities. The use of tools like OWASP Dependency-Check was extremely helpful in identifying vulnerabilities efficiently.

Increasing Layers of Security

To increase layers of security, we implemented HTTPS for secure communication, SHA-256 for data integrity, and conducted thorough dependency checks. In the future, I would use automated tools like Dependency-Check and manual code reviews to assess vulnerabilities and decide on mitigation techniques.

Ensuring Functionality and Security

To ensure the code and software application were functional and secure, we performed extensive testing after refactoring. We verified HTTPS functionality and checksum accuracy and conducted dependency checks to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

Resources, Tools, and Practices

Tools and practices that were particularly helpful included the Java Keytool for SSL certificates, OWASP Dependency-Check for vulnerability scanning, and Spring Boot for easy configuration of secure endpoints. These will be invaluable in future assignments for ensuring secure and robust software.

Showcasing Skills to Employers

For future employers, I would highlight my ability to transition systems to HTTPS, implement data integrity measures like SHA-256, and use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities. Demonstrating the use of industry-standard practices and tools to enhance software security would showcase my skills, knowledge, and experience effectively.
